Envrender - simple config file processor

envrender is a binary that overwrites files after running them through a
templating language processor (go's text/template). It takes the names of the
files to process as command line arguments, and uses environment variables as
the render data.

"-" can optionally be used as a path, in which case it will read a template
from stdin and output the result on stdout.

It also supports one flag, "-e", which takes a string of a command to exec
after it finishes processing files.

The original use-case was for docker containers that utilize links. IP
addresses and ports are provided to the container via environment variables in
this case, but often you want to run software that expects to get those in a
config file. After dropping the envrender binary into your container, you
could for example:

  CMD ["envrender", "-e='node server.js'", "config.json"]

and use "{{.SERVICENAME_PORT_80_TCP_ADDR}}" in the config file, allowing
envrender to replace it with the IP address provided by the docker link before
starting the node server.
