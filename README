Envrender - simple config file processor

envrender is a binary that runs files through a templating language processor
(go's text/template). It takes the names of the files to process as command
line arguments, and uses environment variables as the render data.

If an argument has a colon (":") in it, everything before the colon will be
used as the source file, and everything after will be the destination. "-" can
also be used as an argument, in which case it will read a template from stdin
and output the result on stdout. If neither of those are true of an argument,
it will be treated as both the source and destination paths, overwriting the
file there.

It also supports one flag, "-e", which takes a string of a command to exec
after it finishes processing files.

The original use-case is for docker containers that utilize links. IP
addresses and ports are provided to the container via environment variables in
this case, but often you want to run software that expects to get those in a
config file. After dropping the envrender binary into your container, you
could for example:

  CMD ["envrender", "-e='node server.js'", "config.json"]

and use "{{.SERVICENAME_PORT_80_TCP_ADDR}}" in the config file, allowing
envrender to replace it with the IP address provided by the docker link before
starting the node server.
